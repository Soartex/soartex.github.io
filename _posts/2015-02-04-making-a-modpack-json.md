# Overview

Our server scripts use `modpack.json` files to compile downloads for a modpack. Each modpack has a respective `modpack.json` in the repository that represents each modpack. Each json holds information which the server scripts need to build a download for the pack, in the future we plan on making it easier to create these files by creating a mod for modpack creators to use and generate the files to submit to the repository. This then enables us to offer broader support in terms of downloads, to save the user from downloading our _Universal Downloads_ which contains all the mod patches we offer but this is at a cost of the large file size.

{:#about}
### About
The `modpack.json` system allows us to have the system 99% automated from updating the downloads and distributing the download as the server scripts manage this for us. We will be accepting any type of modpack to be added but the json file submitted must be correct and accurate to the latest build of the modpack. Failing to do so will result in the pull request being closed and for you to re-create/fix the problems stated by one of our staff members.


{:#template}
### Template

{% highlight json %}
{
  "name" : "",
  "version" : "",
  "type" : "",
  "provider" : "",
  "enabled" : true,
  "is_public" : true,
  "minecraft" : [
  ],
  "resourcepacks" : [
  ],
  "mods" : [
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

The json template above can be used for creating a file. Where the `modpack.json` will be called `modpack-name.json` making sure you replace spaces with underscores. Once you have created the file you can send a pull request to the [repository](https://github.com/Soartex-Modded/Modded-Server-Data) to enable the server to create the download for the modpack. When creating the file ensure that you add all the mods (prewfered which do have textures, you can check inside the mod file in the following location to see if it has textures `assets/modid/textures/`) Also add the mods even if Soartex does not support it, this way when we do add support the patch will be included without having to edit the json file.

If you are submitting a `modpack.json` please help us to maintain it from updating the mod listing and the version support. This way we can ensure that the download supports the latest version of the modpack and that the staff can concentrate on creating more texture support and applications for Soartex.

| type | string | This the type of download of which you want to create. You can find the support types [here](#modpack-type) |
| provider | string | This is the provider name who provides the modpack. You can find the support providers [here](#modpack-provider) |

{:#submitting-your-file}
### Submitting Your File

Once you have created your `modpack.json` clone our repository, then add the file to the `/packs/` folder. It is essential that the file is in that folder otherwise the server scripts will not detect the file to compile the modpack download. Lastly push your changes and then submit a pull-request back to our repository to get the file added. Once a member of staff has checked the file they will acppet the request and the file will be added to our repository. Repeat this process when you want to add a new mod to the file or to bump the version.

If however you wish for assistance with submitting the file you can email us for [support](mailto:support@soartex.net?Subject=Soartex%20Wiki%20Contact%20|%20Modpack%20JSON).

# Help

Below is some helpful information on what some of the vairables mean and what values are valid to use when creating a `modpack.json` file.

{:#modpack-type}
### Modpack Type

Our server script supports 2 modpack types currently but the one you would use for creating support for a modpack would be `modded_standard`. Modded standard tells the script that you are wanting to create a download with certain patches which is defined in the "mods" array. The other type is `modded_universal` which will more than offen be used by staff members to create "Universal" downloads, these are basically downloads which contain all the modpack patches we offer on our [modded repositories](https://github.com/Soartex-Modded/).

{:#modpack-provider}
### Modpack Provider

The server script will support an array of launchers to host downloads for but we have refined this down to 3, which we will support officially for downloads. The supported launchers are as followed;

{:.table .table-bordered}
| Launcher Name | Script Value |
|-----------|-------------|
| ATLauncher | atlauncher |
| Feed The Beast | ftb |
| Technic Launcher | technic |

{:#minecraft-versions}
### Minecraft Versions

Soartex currently supports 1.6.x, 1.7.x for modpack compiles, 1.8.x support will be added as soon as more mods port over to the new version.

{:#resourcepacks}
### Resourcepacks

The server script currently supports the following resourcepacks;

{:.table .table-bordered}
| Name | Script Value |
|-----------|-------------|
| Soartex Fanver | fanver |
| Invictus | invictus |

{:#mods-listing}
### Mods Listing

This is a pre-defined listing of mods that you can use to add to your `modpack.json` file. This is not a complete listing and is always work in progress as new mods are adding the mods to the listing.
